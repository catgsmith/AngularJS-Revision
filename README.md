#Part 1 - Controllers

Question 8

Write an AngularJS that has the following behaviour:
•	The Get Name button, when pressed, allows the user to enter their name/email or any string, which is then displayed next to the button.

•	The First character of the string entered, along with its length, is displayed.

•	An input field allows the user to enter the characters of the name to be printed e.g. Every 1st, 2nd 3rd etc. character.

•	If an invalid/negative number is entered the entire string is displayed.

•	If a valid number is entered, e.g. 3, every 3rd character of the string should be displayed.
