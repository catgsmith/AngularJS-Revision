#Part 1 - Controllers

2.	Write an Angular JS application that has 2 Controllers – MainController and SecondController. Each Controller displays an alert saying “Hello from ControllerName” i.e. MainController or SecondController.
The View (HTML) has 2 div elements - one of which is associated with the MainController and one which is not associated with any Controller.
What alerts are shown and why?

3.	Using the AngularJS application from the previous question associate the 2nd div element with SecondController.
Now add a new div element which is also associated with SecondController.
What alerts are shown and why?
