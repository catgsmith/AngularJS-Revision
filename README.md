Question 7

Write an AngularJS Shopping Basket Application that looks as follows:

When the Add button is pressed, the relevant product is added to the shopping basket, the item count for that item increases by one, and the total price of items in the shopping basket is also increased by the price of the product.

When the Remove button is pressed, the relevant product is removed from the shopping basket â€“ but only if at least one such product already exists in the shopping basket, the item count for that item decreases by one, and the total price of items in the shopping basket is also decreased by the price of the product.

The Product Name and Price can be hardcoded in the JS (not the HTML) part of the application.
